        Before arrival of Islam in the region of Gilgit-Baltistan, the majority of the people were Buddhist and they had engraved the Buddha on many rock pieces. This Buddha carving was not known to the world until the beginning of the 20th century due to its remote location. In 1906 the Scottish traveller Ella Christie wrote a book on her journey to Western Tibet and featured the carving in her book which gave it international attention. Since then the government has taken many steps to preserve this monument and it is visited by tourists who visit the Skardu city</p>
